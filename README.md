# **SimulatePanamaCanal_RT_Embedded_TI_RTOS_MSP430**
Given a description of panama canal and how to simulate it, in this project in college course "Real Time Embedded Systems" we were asked to make a simulation of panama canal using TI RTOS Kernel and on MSP430 micro controller card on the Code Composer Studio IDE while following the rules of multithreaded programming and Real Time systems with priority  based scheduler and thus simulating the panama canal as described in the final project specifications. 

### **What the application does?**
Simulating Panama Canal using multithreaded programming and RTOS (real time operating system) principles.

### **Why I used this technologies?**
I used TI-RTOS kernel with the IDE Code Composer because it was a college course project which was required in the course's syllabus.

### **Some challenges**
One of the challenges I faced is one of the critical challenges in Real Time Embedded projects is memory management, cause all things need to be done in a manner of saving memory, timing for buisness or safety crictical systems and this is because: 
   a. those systems usually have small / limited memory capicity proportion to the system needs. 
   b. those systems usually have one main goal which it needs to accomplish and using the memory in a smart and efficient way.
I have managed to put this to the test because without managing the memory the project can't work because as mentioned before this project and even greater project in RTOS embedded needs to meet conditions of memory saving so it can work cause it have limited memory, but saving memory in a more efficient is somthing that can always be improve and always should be in those kind of systems.
